My runthrough of the TicTacToe tutorial project offered in the React Docs.

## To Run

npm install
npm start

## Notes

Fragments allow you to pass multiple elements as a component.

Pass data through props. Props are read-only, immutable and are passed from parent to child.

Make interactive components by defining functions like `handleClick(i)` and passing them to the component as props.

State is private to the component and can be changed by calling `this.setState({})`. State is initialized in the constructor with useState().
